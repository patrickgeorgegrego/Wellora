    <h4><br>
      
      - Cancer<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. These abnormal cells divide and grow at a rapid pace, forming a mass or tumor, which can interfere with normal bodily functions. If the growth is not controlled, it can spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system in a process called metastasis."<br><br>
           
      Causes:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
       Causes: Cancer can be caused by genetic mutations, lifestyle factors (like smoking, excessive sun exposure, or diet), environmental exposures, and certain infections.<br><br>
       
      Symptoms:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Symptoms of cancer can vary widely but often include unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, pain, changes in skin, or lumps that can be felt under the skin.<br><br>
      
      -Heart diseases <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Heart diseases (also known as cardiovascular diseases, or CVDs) refer to a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels.

      -Diabetes <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      "Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that occurs when the body cannot properly regulate blood sugar (glucose) levels. This can happen due to either insufficient insulin production or the body's cells becoming resistant to insulin's effects. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps cells absorb glucose for energy."<br><br>
      
      Causes:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      "Causes and Risk Factors:<br>
      Genetics: Family history of diabetes can increase risk.<br>
      Obesity: Excess body fat, especially around the abdomen, is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes.<br>
      Physical Inactivity: Lack of regular exercise contributes to weight gain and insulin resistance.<br>
      Poor Diet: Diets high in sugar, refined carbohydrates, and unhealthy fats can lead to weight gain and diabetes.<br>
      Age: Risk increases with age, especially after 45.<br>
      Gestational Diabetes: Having this condition during pregnancy raises the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later."<br><br>

It is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, South Asia, and South America."<br><br>
      
      Causes:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
